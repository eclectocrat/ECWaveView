JJWaveView - A clean-room implementation of ArkWaveView
=======================================================

[ArkWaveView] [awv] is a (and perhaps the only) implementation to
browse sound tracks in 2D graphical form with Cocoa and C++. The
only catch is it requires a lot of libraries like MOKit and libsndfile.
This implementation (JJWaveView) aims to remove most of the requirements,
use Mac OS X (10.5+) core frameworks like Core Audio to replace them.
